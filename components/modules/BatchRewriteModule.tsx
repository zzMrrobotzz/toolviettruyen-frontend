DO NOT change it later.

Only if the 'Degree of Change Required' is 0% AND the text has absolutely no errors to fix, should you return the original text verbatim. For any other degree of change, a rewritten output is mandatory.

      \n**CRITICAL NARRATIVE INTEGRITY (SINGLE TRUTH MANDATE):** You are rewriting ONE SINGLE STORY. All details regarding characters (names, roles, relationships, established traits), plot points, events, locations, and timelines MUST remain ABSOLUTELY CONSISTENT with what has been established in previously rewritten chunks of THIS SAME STORY (provided as \`fullRewrittenStory\` context, which is THE CANON for this session) and the initial setup of the current chunk. DO NOT introduce conflicting information or alter established facts. Maintain ONE UNIFIED AND LOGICAL NARRATIVE THREAD.

      \n**Your Task:** Rewrite the provided text chunk.
      \n**Critical Output Requirement:** Your response for this task MUST BE ONLY the rewritten text itself, in the specified Target Language. NO other text, introductions, explanations, or meta-comments are allowed.
      \n**Rewrite Instructions:**
      \n- **Source Language (of the input text):** ${selectedSourceLangLabel}
      \n- **Target Language (for the output text):** ${selectedTargetLangLabel}

          \n  - **Persona Consistency:** Pay close attention to key details that define a character's persona, such as their stated years of experience, specific titles (Dr., Prof.), or recurring personal details. These details MUST be maintained with 100% consistency throughout the entire rewritten text, unless a custom instruction explicitly directs you to change them.

          \n  - **Event, Setting & Situation Coherence:** Ensure events, locations, and plot-relevant objects are plausible and consistent with established facts (from \`fullRewrittenStory\` and the original chunk's premise), respecting the "Degree of Change".

    **HƯỚNG DẪN BIÊN TẬP CHI TIẾT:**
    1.  **Tính nhất quán (Consistency):**
        *   **Tên Nhân Vật (QUAN TRỌNG NHẤT):** Rà soát kỹ TOÀN BỘ "Văn Bản Đã Viết Lại". Đảm bảo MỖI nhân vật (dù chính hay phụ, dù được giới thiệu ở đâu) chỉ sử dụng MỘT TÊN DUY NHẤT và nhất quán trong toàn bộ văn bản bằng ngôn ngữ ${selectedTargetLangLabel}. Nếu có sự nhầm lẫn, thay đổi tên giữa chừng (ví dụ: nhân vật A lúc đầu tên là X, sau lại là Y), hãy sửa lại cho đúng một tên duy nhất đã được thiết lập (ưu tiên tên xuất hiện nhiều hơn hoặc hợp lý hơn).
        *   **Đặc Điểm/Vai Trò Nhân Vật:** Đặc điểm ngoại hình, tính cách, vai trò, mối quan hệ của nhân vật có được duy trì nhất quán từ đầu đến cuối không? Có hành động nào của nhân vật mâu thuẫn với những gì đã được thiết lập về họ trong "Văn Bản Đã Viết Lại" không?
        *   **Logic Cốt Truyện và Sự Kiện:** Các sự kiện có diễn ra hợp lý, tuần tự và logic không? Có tình tiết nào trong "Văn Bản Đã Viết Lại" bị vô lý, mâu thuẫn với các sự kiện trước đó trong chính nó, hoặc tạo ra "plot hole" không? Dòng thời gian có nhất quán không?
        *   **Tính nhất quán Địa Điểm và Chi Tiết:** Địa điểm và các chi tiết bối cảnh quan trọng khác có được mô tả và duy trì nhất quán không?
    2.  **NÂNG CAO CHẤT LƯỢNG VĂN PHONG VÀ LOẠI BỎ TRÙNG LẶP (RẤT QUAN TRỌNG):**
        *   **Loại bỏ Trùng Lặp và Từ Ngữ Thừa:** Rà soát kỹ lưỡng để loại bỏ mọi sự lặp lại không cần thiết về ý tưởng, thông tin, cụm từ, hoặc mô tả. Nếu một chi tiết, sự kiện, hoặc suy nghĩ của nhân vật đã được nêu rõ, tránh diễn đạt lại theo cách tương tự hoặc mô tả lại các chi tiết không cần thiết ở những đoạn văn/câu sau, trừ khi có mục đích nhấn mạnh nghệ thuật đặc biệt và hiệu quả. Tìm cách cô đọng các đoạn văn dài dòng, loại bỏ từ ngữ thừa, câu văn rườm rà để nội dung súc tích và mạch lạc hơn.
        *   **Cải thiện Luồng Chảy và Mạch Lạc (Flow and Cohesion):** Đảm bảo các đoạn văn và câu chuyện chuyển tiếp mượt mà, tự nhiên. Sử dụng từ nối, cụm từ chuyển tiếp một cách hợp lý và đa dạng nếu cần. Sắp xếp lại câu hoặc đoạn văn nếu điều đó cải thiện tính mạch lạc và dễ đọc tổng thể.
        *   **Đa dạng hóa Cấu trúc Câu:** Tránh việc lặp đi lặp lại cùng một kiểu cấu trúc câu đơn điệu (ví dụ: liên tục các câu bắt đầu bằng chủ ngữ - động từ). Hãy thay đổi độ dài câu (ngắn, dài, trung bình) và các kiểu câu (đơn, ghép, phức) để tạo nhịp điệu và làm cho văn bản hấp dẫn, dễ theo dõi hơn.
        *   **Tinh chỉnh Lựa chọn Từ ngữ (Word Choice):** Ưu tiên sử dụng từ ngữ chính xác, giàu hình ảnh, và có sức biểu cảm cao. Tránh các từ ngữ chung chung, sáo rỗng hoặc yếu nghĩa.
        *   **Duy trì Giọng điệu và Phong cách Gốc (của bản viết lại):** Trong quá trình tinh chỉnh, cố gắng duy trì giọng điệu (ví dụ: căng thẳng, hài hước, trang trọng) và phong cách văn chương chung đã được thiết lập trong "Văn Bản Đã Viết Lại". Các chỉnh sửa về văn phong nên nhằm mục đích làm cho nó tốt hơn, không phải thay đổi hoàn toàn bản chất của nó.
    3.  **Mạch Lạc và Dễ Hiểu Chung (Overall Clarity):** Sau các bước trên, đọc lại toàn bộ để đảm bảo văn bản cuối cùng mạch lạc, dễ hiểu, các ý được diễn đạt rõ ràng.
    4.  **Độ Dài:** Cố gắng duy trì độ dài TƯƠNG TỰ như "Văn Bản Đã Viết Lại" được cung cấp. Việc chỉnh sửa chủ yếu tập trung vào logic, nhất quán và chất lượng văn phong, không phải thay đổi độ dài đáng kể, trừ khi thực sự cần thiết để sửa lỗi logic nghiêm trọng hoặc do việc loại bỏ trùng lặp/thừa thãi một cách tự nhiên dẫn đến thay đổi.

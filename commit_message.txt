refactor(modules): Complete migration to AppContext

- Refactored all module components to consume apiSettings and key from AppContext via the useAppContext hook.
- Removed the redundant passing of apiSettings and key as props from App.tsx to all modules.
- This ensures a consistent state management pattern and resolves the potential race condition causing the '(void 0) is not a function' TypeError.
